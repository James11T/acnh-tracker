But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?",

Ah, but let's put insults aside! Sea pineapples are full of water, you sea. And I fear we're asking for a squirt in the eye!",

    "description": "The turban shell is a sea snail with a rather nifty trick up its sleeve...er, shell. You see, this snail carries a hard, round, button-like \"operculum\" with it wherever it goes. What is an operculum, you ask? Why, it is a trapdoor of sorts! When danger approaches, the snail slips into its shell and pulls this trapdoor closed over the opening. Thus it is locked safe and sound inside. And bravo, I say! Bravo! When trouble comes knocking, just do what the turban shell does. Shut the door and turn out the lights!",

Hoo, it's true! With arms stretched wide, they look for all the world like an umbrella! Though surely the last thing the umbrella octopus wants...is to stay dry.",

The Vampire Squid does, in fact, live deep in the ocean where almost no light pervades. But while it looks like it could nibble on your neck...it nibbles on the bits of dead plankton and algae instead. By all accounts, the vampire squid is a a gentle sort who squirts bioluminecesant goo at foes. Sp, how did it get the eerie official name \"Vampyroteuthis inernalis\"? That means \"vampire squid from the heck,\" you see. The problem is that the squid's \"cloak.\" Its arms are webbed with velvet-red skin and lined with toothy spikes. Plainly put, this genial squid looks for all the world like a vampire who went for a swim.",
