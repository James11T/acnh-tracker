    "description": "Trilobites were ancient and extinct before the dinosaurs ever appeared! It boggles the mind! Hoo! They were also one of the most successful classes of animal ever, existing for over 300 million years. Some 50,000 species have been identified in sizes ranging from three millimeters to over two feet! Alas, that is the very limit of my enthusiasm for them, though\u2014 they look rather too much like bugs.",
