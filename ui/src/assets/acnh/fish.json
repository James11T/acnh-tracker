Thus these fish are often found using their prehensile tails to hold tight in amongst the sea grass. And here's one final fact for you...

Once mature, they return to the river where they were born. But when they return depends on the river temperature\u2014 if it's too cold their fishing season will start later. Some even say summer can't start without sweetfish despite the KEY role played by the earth's axial tilt!",
